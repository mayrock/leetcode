 *
 * You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:
 * 
 * 
 * arr.length >= 3
 * There exists some index i (0-indexed) with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such
 * that:
 * 
 * arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
 * arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Given an integer array arr, return the length of the longest subarray, which
 * is a mountain. Return 0 if there is no mountain subarray.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = [2,2,2]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There is no mountain.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
 * 0 <= arr[i] <= 10^4
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * 
 * Can you solve it using only one pass?
 * Can you solve it in O(1) space?
 *
